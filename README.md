# 🔥 LiveSpec — Specs that live beyond implementation

> A universal, tool-agnostic specification framework with visual diagrams, living documentation, and spec-to-code traceability for AI-driven development.

---

## The Problem

Specs today are **throwaway documents**:

- Written once, never updated after implementation
- No visual diagrams — just walls of text
- No traceability between spec requirements and actual code
- No history of what changed and why
- Tools and AI assistants forget the context

Six months later, nobody knows **why** something was built the way it was.

---

## What LiveSpec Does Differently

| Problem | LiveSpec Solution |
|---|---|
| No visuals | **Mermaid diagrams mandatory** in every spec and plan |
| No traceability | **Implementation mapping** — every spec requirement links to `@spec` anchors in code |
| Specs rot after launch | **Living docs** — specs updated when behavior changes |
| No history | **Per-feature changelogs** — every change is recorded |
| No visual testing | **Playwright baselines** built into implementation + check |
| Stack decisions lost | **Stack presets with decision trees** — know WHY you chose each tool |
| One-time init | **Brainstorm-driven init** — AI interviews you before generating anything |
| Tool-specific | **Tool-agnostic** — works with Claude Code or any AI that reads Markdown |

## The 10 Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/spec.init` | 3-phase conversational brainstorm → generates project profile, stack, `.specs/` structure + CLAUDE.md |
| `/spec.propose` | Analyze project context and intelligently propose the next feature(s) to build |
| `/spec.specify` | Create a new feature spec with user stories, Mermaid flows, AC, and FR |
| `/spec.plan` | Generate technical plan with sequence, state, and ER diagrams |
| `/spec.implement` | APEX-style auto-pipeline: implement → test → visual baselines → map to spec. Multi-agent orchestration by default (`--mono` for single-agent) |
| `/spec.check` | Compare spec vs actual code — find gaps, verify AC, detect visual drift |
| `/spec.explain` | "How does X work?" — living documentation from spec + diagrams + history |
| `/spec.stack` | Evolve your stack and analyze impact on existing features |
| `/spec.feature` | Full pipeline: specify → plan → plan review → implement, with validation gates |
| `/spec.refine` | Iteratively refine existing artifacts (project, feature spec, or plan) via guided conversation |

---

## Quick Start

### Claude Code (recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone LiveSpec
git clone https://github.com/julien-m/livespec.git ~/livespec

# 2. Install /spec.* commands globally
bash ~/livespec/scripts/install.sh

# 3. Initialize LiveSpec in your project (creates .specs/ + CLAUDE.md)
cd your-project
/spec.init

# 4. Discover what to build first
/spec.propose

# 5. Create your first feature spec
/spec.specify "User can receive real-time notifications"

# 6. Generate technical plan
/spec.plan notifications

# 7. Implement with auto-pipeline
/spec.implement notifications

# 8. Verify spec vs code
/spec.check notifications

# 9. Explain the feature (living docs)
/spec.explain "how do notifications work?"

# Alternative: full pipeline in one command
/spec.feature "User can receive real-time notifications"
```

### Other AI tools

For any AI tool that reads Markdown, paste the content of `system/spec-system.md` into your tool's context. The spec system is tool-agnostic — any AI that can read `.specs/` will follow the rules.

## Workflow Guide

### Manual flow (step by step)

Run each command individually with full control at every stage:

```bash
/spec.specify "User can filter by date"   # 1. Generate spec.md
/spec.plan date-filter                     # 2. Generate plan.md
/spec.implement date-filter                # 3. Implement from plan
/spec.check date-filter                    # 4. Verify spec vs code
```

### Pipeline flow (`/spec.feature`)

Run the full pipeline in one command with validation gates between each phase:

```bash
# Interactive (default) — pauses for your approval between phases
/spec.feature "User can filter by date"

# Automatic — no pauses, auto-retries if plan review fails
/spec.feature "User can filter by date" --auto

# Resume an interrupted pipeline
/spec.feature --resume date-filter
```

### After implementation

```bash
/spec.check date-filter                    # Verify spec-code alignment
/spec.explain "how does date filtering work?"  # Living documentation
/spec.stack                                # View or evolve the stack
```

## Command Reference

### `/spec.init`

Initialize LiveSpec in a project. Runs a 3-phase conversational brainstorm (interview → stack decisions → file generation).

```bash
/spec.init                    # Full interactive setup
/spec.init --auto             # Use defaults, skip questions
/spec.init --stack web-realtime  # Skip interview, use preset
```

Key flags: `--auto`, `--stack [preset]`, `--dir [path]`, `--dry-run`

### `/spec.propose`

Analyze project context (vision, users, existing features, roadmap) and propose the next feature(s) to build. Read-only — no files created.

```bash
/spec.propose                     # Propose the next feature
/spec.propose --count 3           # Propose 3 ranked features
/spec.propose --role admin        # Focus on admin features
/spec.propose --mvp               # Only MVP-critical suggestions
```

Key flags: `--count N`, `--role [name]`, `--mvp`, `--auto`

### `/spec.specify`

Create a feature spec with user stories, Mermaid flowcharts, AC, and FR.

```bash
/spec.specify "User can upload profile photos"
/spec.specify "Payment processing" --branch --priority P1
```

Key flags: `--branch`, `--no-branch`, `--priority`

### `/spec.plan`

Generate a technical plan with sequence, state, and ER diagrams from a spec.

```bash
/spec.plan profile-photos
/spec.plan profile-photos --no-contracts
```

Key flags: `--no-contracts`

### `/spec.implement`

Auto-implement from plan: code, test, verify, document. Multi-agent by default.

```bash
/spec.implement profile-photos            # Multi-agent (default)
/spec.implement profile-photos --mono     # Single-agent
/spec.implement profile-photos --resume   # Resume interrupted run
```

Key flags: `--mono`, `--economy`, `--resume`, `--no-visual`, `--no-save`, `--step`

### `/spec.check`

Compare spec vs actual code — find gaps, verify AC, detect visual drift.

```bash
/spec.check profile-photos
/spec.check                               # Check all features
```

### `/spec.explain`

Living documentation — understand how a feature works from spec + code + history.

```bash
/spec.explain "how do notifications work?"
/spec.explain profile-photos
```

### `/spec.stack`

View current stack, analyze change impact, create Architecture Decision Records.

```bash
/spec.stack                               # View current stack
/spec.stack "migrate from Supabase to Prisma"
```

### `/spec.feature`

Full pipeline: specify → plan → plan review → implement, with validation gates.

```bash
/spec.feature "Real-time notifications"              # Interactive
/spec.feature "CSV export" --auto                     # Automatic
/spec.feature --resume csv-export                     # Resume
/spec.feature "Dark mode" --mono                      # Single-agent implementation
/spec.feature "Payment processing" --branch --priority P1  # With branch + priority
```

Key flags: `--auto`, `--resume`, `--branch`, `--priority`, `--mono`, `--economy`, `--step`

### `/spec.refine`

Iteratively refine existing artifacts through guided conversation. Enforces eligibility rules — blocks refinement on specs/plans that already have downstream code.

```bash
/spec.refine                        # Interactive menu
/spec.refine project                # Refine project profile, constitution, or testing strategy
/spec.refine notifications          # Refine a feature spec
/spec.refine 002 plan              # Refine a feature plan
```

Key flags: `--auto`, `--dry-run`

## Multi-Agent Mode (default)

`/spec.implement` uses multi-agent orchestration by default — a supervisor dispatches work to 4 specialized agents:

```
                  +-----------------+
                  |   SUPERVISOR    |
                  |  (orchestrator) |
                  +--------+--------+
                           |
         +---------+-------+-------+---------+
         |         |               |         |
   +-----+----+ +-+--------+ +----+-----+ +-+----------+
   | IMPLEMENT| |  VERIFY   | |   TEST   | |    DOC     |
   | (coder)  | | (devil's  | | (tester) | | (writer)   |
   |          | |  advocate) | |          | |            |
   +----------+ +----------+ +----------+ +------------+
```

```bash
# Multi-agent implementation (default)
/spec.implement notifications

# Single-agent mode (original APEX pipeline)
/spec.implement notifications --mono

# Resume an interrupted run
/spec.implement notifications --resume
```

**Per-step cycle:** Implement → Verify (adversarial) → Test → Document checkpoint. The verifier acts as a devil's advocate — no rubber-stamping. Blocking findings are re-dispatched to the implementer (max 3 iterations). Each agent can spawn sub-agents for intra-step parallelism (e.g., writing independent files simultaneously).

Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS: 1` in settings.
