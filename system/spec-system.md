# LiveSpec System — Universal Spec Rules

> **EVERY AI TOOL READS THIS FILE FIRST.**
> This file defines how the spec system works in this project. Follow these rules for every task.

---

## Core Principles

1. **The spec is the functional source of truth, not the code.**
   If the spec says one thing and the code does another, the code is wrong (unless the spec was intentionally updated).

2. **Every feature has a spec — no implementation without a spec.**
   Before writing a single line of code, the corresponding `.specs/features/NNN-feature-name/spec.md` must exist.

3. **Specs are living — updated when behavior changes.**
   When a feature's behavior is modified, the spec.md is updated first (or simultaneously). Specs never become stale.

4. **Specs are visual — Mermaid user flows are mandatory.**
   Every user story in a spec.md must include a Mermaid flowchart. Text-only specs are incomplete.

5. **Code is linked to specs — every implementation is traceable.**
   After implementation, `implementation.md` maps every FR and AC to the `@spec` anchor comment placed directly in the source code (e.g. `// @spec FR-001`). Use `grep -rn "@spec FR-001"` to find the exact location regardless of line number changes.

## Project Layout

When LiveSpec is installed in a project, the `.specs/` directory is the source of truth:

```
.specs/
├── spec-system.md           ← This file (rules)
├── constitution.md          ← Architecture principles for this project
├── project.md               ← Vision, users, constraints
│
├── commands/                ← LiveSpec command docs

## Feature Directory Structure

Each feature lives in `.specs/features/NNN-feature-name/` where `NNN` is a zero-padded sequential number (001, 002, ...).

### spec.md — WHAT and WHY (functional)

**Required sections:**

- **Feature Name** — short, descriptive
- **Branch** — associated git branch
- **Date** — creation date
- **Status** — Draft | Review | Approved | Implemented | Deprecated
- **Input** — original request or user problem

**User Scenarios & Testing:**
- Prioritized user stories: P1 (critical), P2 (important), P3 (nice-to-have)
- Each story includes:
  - Description
  - Priority reason
  - Independent test
  - Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
  - **Mermaid flowchart (MANDATORY)**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Numbered AC-001, AC-002, ...
- Each is testable, specific, and verifiable

**Functional Requirements:**
- Numbered FR-001, FR-002, ...
- Each maps to at least one AC

**Additional sections:**
- Key Entities (data model concepts)
- Edge Cases
- Success Criteria (measurable SC-001, ...)

### plan.md — HOW (technical)

**Required sections:**

- **Summary** — one-line technical approach
- **Technical Context** — language, deps, storage, testing framework, platform, project type
- **Constitution Check** — verify decisions against constitution.md principles
- **Mermaid Sequence Diagrams** — for API/service interactions (MANDATORY when API calls exist)
- **Mermaid State Diagrams** — for entities with states (MANDATORY when entity has lifecycle)
- **Mermaid ER Diagrams** — for data model (MANDATORY when new entities are created)
- **Implementation Plan** — file-by-file, step-by-step
- **Testing Strategy** — which test types for which parts
- **Risks & Considerations**

### implementation.md — WHERE in code (spec↔code links)

Created AFTER implementation, not before. Maps every requirement to actual code.

**Required sections:**

- **Requirement Mapping table:** `| Requirement | File(s) | @spec Anchor | Status | Last Verified |`
- **Status values:**
  - ✅ Implemented — fully implemented and tested
  - ⚠️ Partial — partially implemented
  - ❌ Missing — not yet implemented
  - 🔄 Modified — implementation changed after spec
- **Acceptance Criteria Mapping table:** `| AC | Test File | Status |`
- **Files Created/Modified** — list with descriptions

**Rule: This file MUST be updated after every implementation or modification.**

### changelog.md — WHEN (history)

Per-feature changelog. An entry is added for EVERY change:

**Entry format:**
```
## YYYY-MM-DD — [Type]: Description

- **Type:** Feature | Bugfix | Refactor | Spec Update
- **Spec modified:** Yes (sections: ...) | No
- **Code modified:** file1.ts, file2.ts
- **AC impacted:** AC-001, AC-003
- **Author:** human | tool-name
```

### contracts/ — API contracts

OpenAPI YAML or GraphQL schemas for any API endpoints introduced by the feature.

### baselines/ — Visual test baselines

Playwright screenshot baselines for visual features. Filenames match the test scenario names.

## Rules for AI Tools

### Command discovery

Detailed step-by-step instructions for each `/spec.*` command are available in `.specs/commands/`.
If that directory is missing, run `bash scripts/install.sh` to install it.

### When CREATING a new feature

1. Create the directory `.specs/features/NNN-feature-name/`
2. Generate `spec.md` with all required sections including **Mermaid flowcharts for each user story**
3. Generate `plan.md` with sequence/state/ER diagrams as appropriate
4. After implementation: create `implementation.md` mapping FR/AC to `@spec` anchor comments in source files
5. Add first entry to `changelog.md`

### When MODIFYING existing code

1. **Read the spec FIRST** — locate the feature's spec.md
2. **Verify conformity** — does the requested change conform to the AC?
3. **If behavior changes** — update spec.md first, then code
4. After modification: update `implementation.md` with new `@spec` anchor references
5. Add changelog entry describing what changed and why

### When DEBUGGING

1. Read `spec.md` to understand the expected behavior
2. Read `implementation.md` to find which files contain the relevant code
3. Compare spec vs actual code to identify the gap
4. Fix the issue
5. Update `changelog.md` with a Bugfix entry

### When REVIEWING a feature

1. Run `/spec.check [feature]` to compare spec vs code
2. Check all AC are implemented and tested
3. Check all FR map to files in `implementation.md`
4. For visual features, compare screenshots with baselines
5. Report any gaps

## Mermaid Diagram Requirements

### In spec.md — User Flow (flowchart)

Every user story requires a flowchart:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User action] --> B{Decision point}
    B -- Yes --> C[Outcome A]
    B -- No --> D[Outcome B]
    C --> E[End state]
    D --> E
```

### In plan.md — Sequence Diagram

For any feature involving API calls or service interactions:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant C as Client
    participant A as API
    participant D as Database

    U->>C: Triggers action
    C->>A: POST /resource
    A->>D: Insert record
    D-->>A: record created
    A-->>C: 201 Created
    C-->>U: Shows confirmation
```

### In plan.md — State Diagram

For any entity with a lifecycle:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Active: publish()
    Active --> Archived: archive()
    Active --> Draft: unpublish()
    Archived --> [*]: delete()
```

### In plan.md — ER Diagram

For any feature introducing new database entities:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER {
        uuid id PK
        string email
        timestamp created_at
    }
    NOTIFICATION {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        string type
        string message
        boolean read
        timestamp created_at
    }
    USER ||--o{ NOTIFICATION : receives
```

## Quality Gates

Before a spec is considered complete:
- [ ] All user stories have Mermaid flowcharts
- [ ] All AC are testable (Given/When/Then format)
- [ ] All FR map to at least one AC
- [ ] No more than 3 `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers

Before a plan is considered complete:
- [ ] Sequence diagrams exist for API interactions
- [ ] State diagrams exist for stateful entities
- [ ] ER diagrams exist for new data models
- [ ] Constitution Check section is filled
- [ ] All FR are covered in the implementation plan

Before implementation is considered complete:
- [ ] `implementation.md` is created and all FR/AC have status ✅
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] `changelog.md` has an entry
- [ ] For visual features: Playwright baselines captured in `baselines/`
